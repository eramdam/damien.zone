You can now change the logo displayed at the bottom left of TweetDeck and choose between 25 different variations!
![Screen Shot 2021-06-04 at 12 54 46 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1409924/120766932-8e52d680-c4cf-11eb-8c7c-19c97d401a2e.png)

#### Other features

- You can add a "follow" action to tweets (thanks @hiroto7 https://github.com/eramdam/BetterTweetDeck/pull/605)
- You can show a specific badge for mutuals (people you follow and follow you) https://github.com/eramdam/BetterTweetDeck/pull/624

#### Bugfixes

- Fix a bug where typing ASCII style emoticons was triggering a weird behavior with the emoji completion (Fixes https://github.com/eramdam/BetterTweetDeck/issues/608)
- Fix a bug where BTD would unmount all instances of a given card accross multiple column when one instance would get out of the viewport

- Prevent most occurrences of "jumping around" when scrolling in columns with cards rendering enabled by specifying a minimum height for different kinds of cards ahead of time
  - Also make sure to load cards in replies of a given tweet

‚ö†Ô∏è **For Firefox users only** ‚ö†Ô∏è

The `strict_min_version` of BTD is now **84.0**. Any version lower than that will NOT be supported. The value was kept at 52.0 due to an oversight and I will try to update it regularly.

Date: 2021-06-07
This is a hotfix update after [4.2.0](https://github.com/eramdam/BetterTweetDeck/releases/tag/4.2.0)

### Fixes

- The accent color setting should work again
- The avatar shape setting should work again
- The small composer button setting should work again
- More small fixes around link previews ("cards")

## 4.3.0

Commit: [2880aa04ed7c585c56294195c71300f8bf15383d](https://github.com/eramdam/BetterTweetDeck/commit/2880aa04ed7c585c56294195c71300f8bf15383d)  
Date: 2021-07-05

### Features

- Add a setting to show the account's avatar on top of columns (https://github.com/eramdam/BetterTweetDeck/issues/359)
- Add a setting to change the mutual badge to a double arrow instead of a heart
- Add a setting to add a "Clear all columns" button in the sidebar (https://github.com/eramdam/BetterTweetDeck/issues/471)
- Add a setting that requires all images to have a description before tweeting (https://github.com/eramdam/BetterTweetDeck/issues/530)

### Improvements

- The settings button is now hidden on collapsed columns (https://github.com/eramdam/BetterTweetDeck/issues/630)
- Fix a bug that could occur when closing the tweet composer while having the gif picker opened (https://github.com/eramdam/BetterTweetDeck/issues/619)

## 4.3.2

Commit: [2f663524c8e62ca260d2217f3c4e615b20a3fc0a](https://github.com/eramdam/BetterTweetDeck/commit/2f663524c8e62ca260d2217f3c4e615b20a3fc0a)  
Date: 2021-07-12

### Bugfixes

- The "share on TweetDeck" contextual menu item should work reliably now. You might have to restart your brower after the update to make sure everything sorts itself out

- The accent color should be applied to the "Show more" links in TweetDeck's UI (https://github.com/eramdam/BetterTweetDeck/issues/646)
- The "Clear all" button should properly handle the case where a single column cannot be cleared.

### Improvements

- Some adjustements have been made to the "column navigator" (sidebar) part of the UI as to better accomodate the "Clear all" button.
- Both the "Clear all" and "Clear" buttons on column can now turn into a "Reload" button when holding the Shift button

### Features

Thanks to the recent introduction of [conversation control on already posted tweets](https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1415025551773892608), Better TweetDeck can now use that to set conversation control on tweets.

### Improvements

- BTD should be marked as compatible with Firefox ESR (78 as the time of writing)
- This release adds a failsafe to prevent BTD from accidentally breaking stuff on TweetDeck Preview.
- The "show tweet cards inside columns" feature now uses a more recent way of displaying those cards, resulting in much less memory usage and faster loading times overall. This should also fix all the issues around the scroll "jumping around" issues when those cards were loading.
- I also did a bunch of maintenance/performance stuff, nothing should change functionality-wise!

### Bugfixes

- HTML entities should properly be converted when using the "Re-draft" menu item (see https://github.com/eramdam/BetterTweetDeck/issues/658)

## 4.4.1

Commit: [fc568341cd120635603bb705930e97960acf147b](https://github.com/eramdam/BetterTweetDeck/commit/fc568341cd120635603bb705930e97960acf147b)  
Date: 2021-09-27

- Updates to the German, Japanese and Brazilian Portuguese translations
- Add a regex filter for display names (https://github.com/eramdam/BetterTweetDeck/issues/676)
- By default the image description requirement setting **will not** apply to the DM composer. You can enable it there with a new setting now (https://github.com/eramdam/BetterTweetDeck/issues/666)
- The emoji composer, completion, and replacement in tweets now supports [Unicode 13.1](https://emojipedia.org/emoji-13.1/) so emoji like üòµ‚Äçüí´ü•≤ can be inserted and will be displayed properly

- You can enable a setting to let Better TweetDeck try to detect users' pronouns from their biography/location. If you see a false positive/detection error please let me know on [@Eramdam](https://twitter.com/Eramdam) or [@BetterTDeck](https://twitter.com/BetterTDeck)

Both of these new settings can be found in the "Tweet content" section of the settings!

### Changes / Bugfixes

- Better TweetDeck now has its own custom banners instead of relying on TweetDeck's own banners. They look prettier and should prevent confusion/weird issues with TweetDeck's own system

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1409924/139723327-aacd7dfb-7086-4d26-bbe2-f31ab17f1a55.png)

### "Mute catches" modal

Starting with this release, Better TweetDeck will keep track of users whose tweets are hidden by the different mutes you set up.
The list of users is accessible by going to the Settings -> Mute pane of TweetDeck.
Once you're there, you will be able to review, sort, and export those users in different formats, which can be useful for making sure your mutes aren't too "greedy" or to get a list of users to block/

### Important announcement

This release probably will be the very last one for the time being.
I decided to put BTD in a "feature freeze" state and will only address critical bug fixes should they arise until the eventual rollout of the new TweetDeck that will break BTD entirely. Please read the following issue for more details https://github.com/eramdam/BetterTweetDeck/issues/848.

Note that this decision was taken before the Elon Musk takeover of Twitter, but this situation confirms my intention of not wanting much to do with TweetDeck until the new version releases, or it disappears/breaks completely. Thank you all for using and supporting the project, and thank you to the Tweeps who allowed it to stay alive and contributed/worked on TweetDeck. ü´°

[See also thread on Twitter about this release](https://twitter.com/BetterTDeck/status/1591747755864907777)

### Feature highlight

Add a setting to show a badge for accounts that are ["Blue verified"](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts). **This setting is opt-in**. Who knows if this whole thing will still be up by the time this update reaches you? Oh well!

### Other changes

- Add settings to highlight/mute tweets made in a Twitter Circle (https://github.com/eramdam/BetterTweetDeck/pull/853 thanks @Vogeslu)
- Migrate the Chrome extension to Manifest V3. This shouldn't break or change anything, but Google will stop accepting Manifest V2 extensions soon, so this was needed. I'll be doing a similar update when Mozilla/Apple starts accepting Manifest V3 extensions.
- Made tooling optimizations to have smaller files so Mozilla's validation system wouldn't reject the extension because of its size.
- More fixes around content warnings detection.
- Fixes around the "show link preview" setting.
- Mark the extension as requiring Safari 15.4 at a minimum due to the switch to Event Pages.

### Important

Since the [last release back in November of 2022](https://github.com/eramdam/BetterTweetDeck/releases/tag/4.9.0) it is clear that Twitter [doesn't](https://www.engadget.com/twitter-new-developer-terms-ban-third-party-clients-211247096.html) [give a shit](https://twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/1621026986784337922) about 3rd party developers and apps so I will not be spending any more time and energy developing on top of Twitter's platform.

Thank you for using and supporting Better TweetDeck over the years, it was a wild ride, I wish it didn't end this way but it is what it is.

I know I said the last update was the last one, but I felt like the changes Twitter made over the Verified status warranted at the very least that BTD displayed those badges properly to avoid confusion.

- This release shows Business and Government verified badges independently from the Blue badges. It also fixes a bug where those accounts would show up with the Blue badge despite not being actually subscribed to Blue(? I don't think? Twitter's API says they're "Blue verified" regardless so who knows ü§∑ )
- Adds a "Mute accounts subscribed to Twitter Blue" option, you can find it by going to the ‚öôÔ∏è icon -> Mute
