Better TweetDeck was a project I started back in 2014 to make TweetDeck... better! in the summer of 2023, Twitter (acquired by Elon Musk) killed TweetDeck off to replace it by the unfinished and paywalled "X Pro", killing Better TweetDeck in the process. The writing was on the wall, but I took the project down as well.

At its peak, Better TweetDeck had ~70,000 weekly users on the various browser add-on marketplaces.

## Mac Themes Bot

[Twitter](https://x.com/macintoshthemes) - [Mastodon](https://social.erambert.me/@macthemes) - [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/macthemes.bsky.social) - [https://github.com/eramdam/shapeshifter-themes](https://github.com/eramdam/shapeshifter-themes)

![Screen Shot 2024-09-26 at 22](/img/projects/23.png)

Back in 2018(!), I set up a bot that posts themes for [Kaleidoscope](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaleidoscope_(software)>) (Classic Mac) and [ShapeShifter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsanity#Software) (Mac OS X).
I did it to follow the path of [@kaleidoscopemac](https://web.archive.org/web/20191021204432/https://twitter.com/kaleidoscopemac) on Twitter.  
In late-2023, I started "re-archiving" the ~4,000 schemes that are available for Kaleidoscope specifically. I hope to, sometime next year, make a website out of it.

## Mastodon Archive Viewer

[Demo](https://eramdam.github.io/mastodon-archive-viewer/) - [https://github.com/eramdam/mastodon-archive-viewer](https://github.com/eramdam/mastodon-archive-viewer)

An [Astro](https://astro.build)-based Mastodon archive viewer. I couldn't find any archive viewer I liked, so I just built my own in ~3 days. Fun learning experience.

A "swipe-based" tool that lets you clean up your Mastodon followings list. Based off [Tokimeki Unfollow](https://tokimeki-unfollow.glitch.me/) by [Julius Tarng](https://tarng.com/). One of the many "it doesn't exist, so I'll build it myself" tools.

A CLI tool that can output sprites of any (up to gen 8) Pokémon in your terminal. Very useful to show in tools like [hyfetch](https://github.com/hykilpikonna/hyfetch/)

## starry-raindrop
