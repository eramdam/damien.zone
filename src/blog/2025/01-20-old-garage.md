I've done some tweaks to the layout of the site around [links](https://damien.zone), `code bits` and other things I'm probably forgetting.

Oh, yeah, and the blog has [Webmentions](https://nex-3.com/blog/a-non-technical-intro-to-webmentions/) support now! Meaning that if you mention my blog from your website or on social media (Bluesky, Mastodon), it should appear alongside comments on the blog. 

**Also**, if you had my button on your website, and you included the direct link, please update it like so, replacing `https://files.damien.zone/88x31_damien.png` with `https://damien.zone/public/88x31_damien.png`. I have set up a redirection on my server, so existing buttons don't break, but ideally that'd be temporary ðŸ˜…

That's all!
