A little post to tell the folks who are only reading the RSS feed about what I've been up to on damien.zone:

I got a [links](https://damien.zone/links) page with:

- my own links!
- nice buttons I keep seeing on people's websites! I'll try to collect more as time goes on
- I have a button too!! [Gwyn](https://shadenexus.com/) absolutely killed it, you can grab it on there as well
- friends' links and just cool links in general

I started a [projects](https://damien.zone/projects) page. It has _almost_ everything I would care about publicizing on here. The big thing missing are links for my Mac Themes bot that people enjoyed on cohost. I'll remedy that. In the meantime, you can find the bot on [Mastodon](https://botsin.space/@osxthemes), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/macthemes.bsky.social) as well as [Twitter](https://x.com/macintoshthemes).

I have a "final cohost post" ready to send on next Monday (September 30th). I might mirror it here, we will see.

I have another, longer, "my online life" type post that I don't think will be ready before cohost's goes read-only. As luck would have it, I already had plans for this weekend, so I won't have much time to spend on a computer before Monday. But I hope it'll be at least slightly interesting when I'm done with it! The hardest part will be to edit myself to not write _too much_, haha.

I also ported my old blog posts over to this blog. I don't think they showed up on the RSS feed (at least I hope they didn't) so, in case you weren't aware:

- Better TweetDeck post-mortem [part one](https://damien.zone/bettertweetdeck-post-mortem-part-1-faq/) and [part two](https://damien.zone/bettertweetdeck-post-mortem-part-2/). Part two is probably the one you'll want to read in 2024.
- ["The intersection of liberal arts and technology"](https://damien.zone/intersection-of-liberal-arts-and-technology/). Kind of a rant/thinking out loud post I wrote at like, 10pm on a weekday back then.. It's messy but I still stand by everything I said in there.
- [Running my own Mastodon instance "behind" Astro on Vercel](https://damien.zone/astro-and-mastodon-instance/). Very specific/technical so idk, if you happen to run your own Mastodon/fediverse instance _and_ also have a website hosted on Vercel, maybe you might find this useful? Who knows.

Cheers,
