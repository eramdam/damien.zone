So. [cohost](https://cohost.org/staff/post/7611443-cohost-to-shut-down), huh?

If you're reading this, you probably know me from that place (or at least have heard about it) so I don't think it's really useful to try to give you the "elevator pitch".

what would a pitch be useful for anyway, right?

I have _a lot_ I want to say about cohost. but I think the shutdown announcement is still too recent for me to be able to form any coherent thoughts yet.

the one thing that I will say about cohost is that it, as a site and "community"[^2], taught me that I can "exist online"[^1] without worrying about being "clean" or "proper" or "right".

most of my existence online was on micro-blogging platforms with short character limits and a high incentive to product the "One Good Take" about everything and anything. and I'm frankly done with that.

or at least I'm done with it being my only outlet for Thoughts online. and I have cohost to thank for for letting me experiment and find this out about myself.

I already have a [website](https://erambert.me/) that I was planning on using as my new place for long/medium form writing but after trying (and failing) to get anything written there I came to a conclusion. my friend evie is right in that ["you gotta make it easy to post"](https://cohost.org/ewie/post/7707570-guys-who-are-moving).

as far as I can tell bearblog seems to strike a right balance between making it easy and letting me tinker with things while not letting me fall into what some might call "the developer's blog curse". so here I am.

[erambert.me](https://erambert.me) will still exist as "the website I give by default" both because I like the separation of "concerns" ('business card type site' versus 'just me writing') and also because _so much_ is tied to this domain that I refuse to mess with it.
anyway!

this is [damien.zone](https://damien.zone).

I'm nervous, I'm sad, I have thoughts, I'm excited to try this. let's go and post about it like it's 2007 again.

pardon the mess, appreciate you <3

[^1]: whatever that means

[^2]: I don't like saying social media sites have "a community" because there's so many people on them but _I_ definitely had something I would call a community on cohost
