For the longest time, on cohost, I kept saying "man, I should try to organize _something_ to meet up with the Bay Area folks".  
It almost became a running gag because I would post about it, and never act on it for many reasons. So when the shutdown of cohost was [announced](https://cohost.org/staff/post/7611443-cohost-to-shut-down), and after seeing the [Seattle](https://nex-3.com/blog/seattle-cohost-wake/) and [Philly](https://cohost.org/shel/post/7893527-at-the-philly-cohost) "cohost wakes" being planned, I went "fuck it, we ball".  
I posted about it, people said they'd be interested, [Nicky](https://nickyflowers.com/) and [Diane](https://cohost.org/diane?page=0) helped me actually find a spot and time, and I [announced it](https://cohost.org/eramdam/post/7750903-yeah-sf-bay-area). I was diligently keeping track of who had replied and how, to have an at least vague idea of how many people would show up.

18 days later, earlier today as I write this: we had **40 people** show up!! I don't actually have a group picture to show because I wasn't the one who took them and not everyone wants to be visible publicly in such a picture, so you'll have to take my word for it.

In fact, I barely had any time to take many pictures myself! The only ones I have are of [Cohost 2](https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/damien/img_7695-2.webp), a huge scroll of paper that Nicky brought so we could make posts by hand.  
It was a lot of fun, wish I took more pictures. But I feel chatting with people, recognizing folks from the website and having a good time was more important than taking pictures, you know?

People hung out, some of them played a fighting game with specialized controllers[^1], people talked about the website, nerd shit, linguistics, and a bunch of other things. Emails were gathered so people could organize and try to make this a more recurring thing, now that we know we can motivate at least _some_ people to meet up.

Cohost really was [like a website](https://web.archive.org/web/20240916171700/https://cohost.org/lukedotorg/post/234549-it-s-like-a-website), it was a website that somehow got us to actually touch grass and is making us think about touching more grass in the future. And I think that's really neat.

Eggbug forever,

P.S: if you were there and have pictures you're willing to share with me, I'd love to see them! Email me at [damien@erambert.me](mailto:damien@erambert.me).
