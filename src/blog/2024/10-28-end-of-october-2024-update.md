Hello, little blog, it's been a while! The past two weeks have been uncharacteristically busy for me so, huh, I didn't write much here, oops!

I spent a week of vacation in Reno for definitely [normal reasons](https://goblfc.org/). Turns out, being mostly offline with your friends and other freaks (complimentary) for a whole week is good??? Someone should look into this.

Then, as soon as I came back, my friend [Joanna](https://www.joannablackhart.com/) was in town to visit the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/), so I tagged along. I saw a bunch of very cool shit. Like, look at all this stuff!! Tell me this isn't cool as hell!!
Excuse the shoddy photography job lmao.

A 16mm film scanner! It was super impressive to see move in person, especially considering how "tiny" 16mm film is in comparison.

I had other pictures, but they were all of Just Old Stuff. This is also just Old Stuff, but at least it's Devices! I'm never beating the nerd allegations.

Overall, meeting so many people and seeing so much stuff in the span of three nights was overwhelming but also great. The Internet Archive rules, man.

Finally, literally last night, I met with [Nicky](https://nickyflowers.com/) to give [cohost 2](https://damien.zone/bay-area-cohost-wake/) back to them. We then hung out at the [Musée Mécanique](https://museemecanique.com/). Given the "touristy" status of the place, I feel like I should have heard about it a long time ago, but it was my first time there, and it was super neat! Digital stuff is cool, but there's something just _neat_ about seeing mechanical contraptions, you know? Nicky took some cool pictures there, you should [check them out](https://nickyflowers.com/blog/post_102724)

On the nerd side of things, I spent some part of my weekend tinkering with fonts and color stuff on the site. The notable changes are:

- background/text colors are warmer, especially in light mode.
- the headings are now using [Young Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Young+Serif) instead of Hack (a monospaced font) and, more importantly, are dark red anymore. As much as I like my deep-red accent color, it got old pretty quickly on the headings, in my opinion. I'm still keeping it for link underlines, at least for now.
- The Comentario buttons are also red now, yay.
- Other small details.

I will most likely continue fucking around with the blog's theme because that's just how it goes, but this one felt significant enough to mention in a post.

November should be much quieter, so hopefully I'll be able to post more on here.

Have a good one!
