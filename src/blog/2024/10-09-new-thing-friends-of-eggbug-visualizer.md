Cohost started to send data exports to users. As soon as I got mine last night, I went to look at my "find my friends" page. It's very convenient! But unfortunately, I don't really like looking at tables for that stuff...

So, of course, I wrote a tool to scratch that itch. It's called "Friends of eggbug visualizer"[^1], it works in the browser, no data is sent anywhere, and it keeps your list in your browser's own storage. This way you can import your `find-your-friends.json` file once, and keep coming back to the list later on to go through your list.
