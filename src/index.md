French software engineer living and working in the Bay Area on web stuff.

You may know me as "Damien", or "eramdam" or even "damien cohost", for [Better TweetDeck](https://better.tw), as "the guy with Sakamoto from Nichijou as an avatar", for the [Mac Themes Bot](https://damien.zone/projects/#mac-themes-bot), or [VLC for Mac OS X](https://www.macstories.net/news/vlc-2-0-for-mac-final-design-previewed-coming-this-week/) and [VLC for iOS](https://www.macstories.net/news/vlc-for-ios-returns-to-the-app-store/).
